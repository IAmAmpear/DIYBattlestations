                    The computer case serves mainly as a way to physically mount and contain all of the actual components inside of a computer, like the motherboard, hard drive, optical drive, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Cases usually contain multiple 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch expansion bays for optical drives, floppy disk drives, hard drives, and other media drives.
                    <br><br>
                    The rear of the computer case contains small openings to fit the connectors contained on the motherboard which is mounted inside. The power supply is also mounted just inside the back of the case and a large opening allows for the connection of the power cord and use of the built-in fan.

                    Alternatively referred to as the mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, system board, or a logic board on Apple computers. The motherboard is a printed circuit board and foundation of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis.
                    <br><br>
                    It allocates power and allows communication to and between the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.
                    <br><br>
                    Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.

                    It is the core component of what defines a computing device, but it isn’t the sole component — it’s just the brains.
                    <br><br>
                    CPUs are built by placing billions of microscopic transistors onto a single computer chip.
                    <br><br>
                    Modern CPU consists of multiple cores that allow it to perform multiple instructions at once. Some processors also employ a technology called multithreading. Imagine a single physical CPU core that can perform two lines of execution (threads) at once.
                    <br><br>
                    Clock speed  — the “gigahertz” (GHz) is a number that denotes how many instructions a CPU can handle per second, but clock speed mostly comes into play when comparing CPUs from the same product family or generation.

                    Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory. It is the super-fast and temporary data storage space that a computer needs to access quickly.  In contrast, a computer’s hard disk or SDD is its long-term memory, where things are stored more or less permanently.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s very fast, which makes it ideal for things the computer is actively working on, such as applications, the web and the data those applications work on or with.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, RAM allows you to access multiple programs at once with speed and efficiency.
                    <br><br>
                    In a game or program, that “loading” message is displayed to ensure you know something is happening, when the developers cannot make the process instantaneous!

                    The graphics processing unit(GPU), has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing.
                    <br><br>
                    Although they’re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence(AI).
                    <br><br>
                    While CPUs have continued to deliver performance increases, GPUs are specifically designed to accelerate computer graphics workloads
                    <br><br>
                    GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card and is embedded alongside the CPU. But a discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own circuit board, known as Graphics Card and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.

                    Data storage is the collective methods and technologies that capture and retain digital information on electromagnetic, optical or silicon-based storage media.
                    <br><br>
                    Spinning HDDs use platters stacked on top of each other coated in magnetic media with disk heads that read and write data to the media. HDDs are widely used storage in personal computers, servers and enterprise storage systems, but SSDs are starting to reach performance and price parity with disk.
                    <br><br>
                    On solid-state drives (SSDs), data is written to pooled NAND flash, designed with floating gate transistors that enable the cell to retain an electrical charge. Unlike spinning disk drives(HDD), SSDs have no moving parts.

                    Abbreviated as PS or P/S, power supply or PSU (power supply unit) is a hardware component of a computer that supplies all other components with power. The power supply converts a 110-115 or 220-230 volt AC (alternating current) into a steady low-voltage DC (direct current).
                    <br><br>
                    The power supply is located at the back of the computer, usually at the top or in recent tower computer cases in the bottom back of the case.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything contained in the computer chassis is powered by the power supply. For example, the motherboard, RAM, CPU, hard drive, disc drives, and most video cards. Additionaly any other external devices and peripherals, such as the computer monitor, keyboard and mouse.

                                Additionaly, if you dont have anti-static wrist strap, you can just take out the motherboard from the box and lay it on top of that same box and work with it there, so that it is easier to work with.

                                As mentioned earlier, components are fragile and can be bent or broken by haphazard handling. If a piece isn’t fitting where you think it’s “supposed to,” that may be because you’re installing it wrong, not because you’re failing to shove it in aggressively enough. If you’re certain you’re inserting the right part into the proper spot but it’s not fitting correctly, try rotating the component.

                                Eventually you’ll have a bunch of cables in there, which can make it hard to see around the case or motherboard and remove a good airflow. Also, when you’re done, your build will look a lot sleeker, professional and impressive if your cables are neat and orderly. You can always fix this later, but who wants to take two steps backwards to get one step forward? Keep your cables neat by carefully untangling them beforehand and adding them to the build while vigilantly avoiding interweaving with cables already in place, most PC cases have a space behinde the panel of the motherboard that have a space to get your cables behinde. You can also use zip ties to group installed cables together and give you more space in the case, but don't overuse it, as it will look silly later.

                                Installing the I/O backplate can be a frustrating process. You need to make sure it is flushed against the case; it will likely making a clicking noise when installed properly. Use two fingers to cover the length of the backplate, and push it in while eyeing the outside of the case to ensure proper alignment. Extend two fingers to two diagonally opposite corners. Pop those corners in before moving over to the next corners. Run your fingers along the backplate’s perimeter to make sure it’s in all the way.

                                As soon as your computer is built and powers on, the first thing you need to do is to install Windows or Linux. Prepare a USB boot drive in advance. If you don't already have a copy of Windows or Linux, you can buy one online. There you can find a guide on how to boot them into your newly built PC.
