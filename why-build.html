                                By building your own computer, it will cost you much less than if you bought a pre-built system from the store. And you can get build one that is just based on your specific wants and needs.
                                <br><br>
                                You can build a basic PC for normal internet usage for about €300. These builds are perfect if you just want to send emails, browse the web, and stream videos
                                <br><br>
                                Gamers can build a solid entry-level gaming PC for as low as €400-€700.  If you want something a little nicer than an entry-level model, you can build a gaming PC that can handle most games at max settings on a 1080p monitor for €800 or more.  For gamers that want to play on monitors with higher resolutions and refresh rates, or who want to get into virtual reality gaming, spending €900 or more on the best gaming PC components possible should get the job done.
                                <br><br>
                                In comparison to a pre-built system you’d get from the store, building your own computer can give you the same performance for a fraction of the cost and more perfomance.

                                If you determine that it isn’t performing to your liking, or you just want to upgrade, replacing those parts is a even simple process.  But people that want to upgrade components on their pre-built, will have more difficulties, which will make them pay to have someone else make the upgrades.
                                <br><br>
                                Upgrading parts on your custom-built gaming PC is much cheaper, and it’s often as simple as removing the component and replacing them with the upgraded component.

                                One of the biggest problems with pre-built computers is that their cooling systems are not always efficient for gamers.  These machines get built on assembly lines and are just full with components in a tight space, which limits the airflow.  They just don’t have enough fans or the cables interfere with the airflow and sometimes it's both!
                                <br><br>
                                When you have to choose a case for your build, you can select one that has many options for cable management, as well as the many slots to install fans.  Even with mid-range builds, you should be able to find a case that allows for two or three fans. 
                                <br><br>
                                If you build a high-end gaming PC, you’ll have even more options to add fans and liquid cooling radiators. When your cooling system operates at a high level, the airflow allows your components to last a lot longer, which ends up saving you time and money in the long run.

                                Whether you are a student or an adult, building a PC gives you an advantage over those who haven't built their own computer.  We live in an era where computers are everywhere we go; they are in businesses, households, cars, and even in our pockets.  Understanding how these machines are put together is an important life skill.

                                If your computer has problems, you can fix it yourself.  Maybe your parents, friends, children, or other relatives are having computer trouble, rather than spending thousands of dollars to replace or fix them, they can call you over, and you can help diagnose and fix it yourself and even get some money in return. Having the ability to build and fix a computer, can benefit you for the rest of your life.

                                What is bloatware?  Do you ever wonder why your computer is running so slow?  It’s not even a year old, and you haven’t installed anything harmful on the system.  Bloatware isn’t destructive or dangerous to your system, but it slow things down by taking up unnecessary process power on your CPU and space on your hard drive.
                                <br><br>
                                The manufacturers installs all kinds of unnecessary software on your computer that you don't even use.  Antivirus and security software are the most common.  You get to use the software for a month or so and then it just takes up space on your hard drive if you don’t renew the subscription.
                                <br><br>
                                If you build your computer, you won’t have to worry about any of these.  Since you are going to install the software yourself, you’re not going to include any unnecessary applications that slow down the performance of your computer.

                                If you are a teenager or a young adult that is interested in building a computer, the process will help you mature faster and teach you some responsibility.  PC parts are expensive, and if you are paying for it with your own money, then you will quickly learn the value of money, you don’t want to flush the money down the toilet.
                                <br><br>
                                Once the computer gets built, you’ll be carefull with it and keep it away from liquids, dirt, dust, and anything else that could damage your machine.  If you’re not careful with your newly built computer, a mistake could end up costing you up to €1,000. These factors will give you a lesson in responsibility.

                                Don’t just build a PC without knowledge.  Reach out to experts and other peers to get some advice during the process.  There are plenty of online communities where people discuss their own experience building different machines, and their knowledge is useful.  You should at least read through some to avoid making some common rookie mistakes.

These communities are special because everyone shares a common interest and are more than happy to help and give some advice.
