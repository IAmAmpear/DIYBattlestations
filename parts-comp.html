                                As you know, the processor is the brain of the computer. So first, we have to choose the brain. While choosing the processor, we got two main-streamed lines, AMD and Intel.
                                <br>
                                Intel processors aren't backward compatible as the AMD. It changes generation and compatibility with every generation update, where's when we talk about the AMD, they're backward compatible and are compatible with predecessor motherboard.

                                Once you select the processor, the next thing you've to look at is the motherboard. It is another most important component, and while selecting the motherboard, the first thing you should have to do is, match their socket type with the processor.
                                <br>
                                Next to it, you've to check the chipset supported by your processor with the motherboard. So, in this case, you've to check the chipset supported by your processor and look out at the motherboard, which supports the same chipset.

                                While selecting the graphics card, you don't have to match the socket type or chipset like we do in the motherboard - but we have to look at the PCIe interface.
                                <br>
                                PCIe interface are backward compatible, so a graphics card with PCIe 3.0 works well with PCIe 2.0 port in motherboard - but look for the motherboard, which supports the latest PCIe interface for optimal performance.

                                Most of the people get confused while choosing RAM because of the speed and capacity issue. But don't worry! Speed in RAM simply means the speed it can go up to. A DDR4 based RAM has a stock speed of 2133 MHz and anything above it simply means it can be overclocked.
                                <br>
                                And when it comes to the capacity, I highly recommend you to grab anything above 16GB and if you wanted to do hardcore gaming, then I suggest you to grab minimum 32GB of RAM.

                                SSDs are much faster than mechanical hard drives. We recomend getting 1TB HDD for files, documents or weak programs, and a 256GB SSD for OS, games or heavy programs.

                                When it comes to compatibility, they come in two different types, Liquid Cooler and Air Cooler. As the name, a Liquid cooler uses water to cool down your processor from overheating whereas an air cooler uses air to cool it down. 
                                <br>
                                This is why liquid coolers are much more efficient than normal coolers but with great pros, there are great cons of using liquid cooler, it can be dangerous for your system if water leaks into hardware.

                                If anyhow you got a power supply with under wattage, the chances are, your system will not even boot up properly.

                                Along with it, you should have to look at the size of the power supply you're getting to buy.

                                Mostly the power supply comes in standard ATX packages, which is fine - but I still recommend you to once check the form factor of your power supply. And don't cheap out here!

                            Another thing which you need to make sure of is, some motherboards with EATX sizes can also fit in the Mid Tower case.

                            Plus, check if the case has decent cable routing? If there are fans included, are they decent? What fans does it support, and how many? How many 2.5 and 3.5 inch internal bays are there for drives?
