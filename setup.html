        <h2>Steps to optimize your setup</h2>
        <div class="optimize-setup-card">
            <h3>Monitor</h3>
            <img class="setup-tips-img" src="images/monitor.png">
            <p>
                Monitors are a very important aspect of your setup. After all you can only interact with your PC if you have one, right? When deciding on which one to get you have to take into account some details. Are you mostly gonna be gaming, working or editing?
            </p>
            <ul class="setup-tips">
                <li>
                    If you are a hardcore gamer then you should look into monitors with a high refresh rate and low input lag. Monitors with those panels will give you the best gaming experience, both in terms of smoothness and giving you a competitive edge over those who are using regular 60Hz displays.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If on the other hand you use your PC mostly for working and editing, then the best displays for you would be those rocking IPS panels, as those have the best color accuracy of any display type currently on the market.
                </li>
            </ul>                
        </div>
        <div class="optimize-setup-card">
            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <img class="setup-tips-img" src="images/chair.png">
            <p>
                Your desk chair is crucial to maintain your comfort after long hours of gaming or work sessions.
            </p>
            <ul class="setup-tips">
                <li>
                    If you are someone that games only in small to medium session lenghts then you will probably like the comfort that a gaming chair with a really pluffy cushion can give you. Only downside is that these types of cushions tend to wear down and over time you will end up sitting closer to the base of the chair rather than on the cushion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But if you spend almost all day at your desk, then it is highly recommended that you invest in a really good chair that will save your back in the long run. For example, a chair with a sturdier cushion, with a good design that naturally fits your back and with ajustable arm rests would be the best option.
                </li>
            </ul>                
        </div>
        <div class="optimize-setup-card">
            <h3>Keyboard</h3>
            <img class="setup-tips-img" src="images/keyboard.png">
            <p>
                Your keyboard is the tool you probably use the most to interact with your PC, so if your budget allows, you should look into getting a keyboard with a nice feel and that will last you a long time.
            </p>
            <ul class="setup-tips">
                <li>
                    Not even considering whataver it is that you do on your PC, if possible avoid getting a membrane keyboard. They don't feel good to use and they are a lot more fragile than mechanical keyboards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When choosing a mechanical keyboard you have to take into account what you do. If you only use your PC to game, then getting a keyboard with blue or clicky switches might be a good option. These switches have a lot of travel so you won't press excess keys on accident. But if you do anything else on your PC besides gaming, then you should get a keyboard with red, brown or tactile switches. These will give you the smoothest typing experience possible, which is important if you have to be typing words all day long.
                </li>
            </ul>                
        </div>
        <div class="optimize-setup-card">
            <h3>Mouse</h3>
            <img class="setup-tips-img" src="images/mouse.png">
            <p>
                Your mouse is the tool you use to make precise movements or in some instances to get somewhere faster than using the keyboard. It is also a very important input device for gaming.
            </p>
            <ul class="setup-tips">
                <li>
                    If you just use your computer for work or editing then getting a mouse that fits your grip style and has a nice feel is probably more than enough. Those kinds of tasks usually don't require super precise or really fast movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But if you care a lot about competitive gaming then it would be best to get a more feature rich mouse. Like a mouse with low weight, wireless connectivity, low latency and a few buttons.
                </li>
            </ul>                
        </div>
        <div class="optimize-setup-card">
            <h3>Desk</h3>
            <img class="setup-tips-img" src="images/desk.png">
            <p>
                Of course we can't talk about setups without mentioning desks. In the end, everything on your setup stays in here.
            </p>
            <ul class="setup-tips">
                <li>
                    Avoid geting desks that don't have cable management in mind, otherwise your setup will look disorganized and you might even get your feet tangled in all the mess of wires you'll eventually have.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try to get a desk that will allow you to attach a monitor arm. That way you can adjust the monitor's position to your liking so you can maximize comfort for both your eyes and back.
                </li>
            </ul>
